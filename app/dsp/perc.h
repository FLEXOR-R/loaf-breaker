/* CHOPPAH's snare and hi-hat (PRD K-10): two synthesised voices beside the kick (kick.h), each with six settings
 * (0..1), presets, and a lane of the pattern's 16 steps (the app's). LOAF BREAKER: a third, the CLAP: four bursts of
 * band-passed noise (TUNE its band, SNAP how far apart), then a tail (DECAY); TONE brighter. (The RAVE STAB, the
 * HOOVER and the MELODY that followed it: gone in 0.209, kicks and drums only.)
 *   SNARE  a body of two detuned sines dropping onto TUNE, and noise band-passed by TONE; SNAP is how much noise and
 *          crack against the body; DECAY both their tails; DRIVE a soft clip
 *   HAT    six square oscillators at an 808's ratios (TUNE) against noise (TONE), high-passed at CUT; DECAY from a
 *          tight closed hat to an open one; DRIVE
 * Platform-free, like the break engine: settings from the main loop (perc_set, read once a block), hits at sample
 * offsets in the render. */
