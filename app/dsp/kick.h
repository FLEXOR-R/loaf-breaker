/* CHOPPAH's kick (PRD K-*): a synthesised kick of four layers for gabber, hardcore and techno over the break.
 *   SUB    the low foundation: a sine dropping to its pitch, a long tail
 *   PUNCH  the hit and the body: a sine swept fast from far above (909 style)
 *   GRIT   the dirty mids: FM through a drive, noise mixed in by its tone
 *   CLICK  the transient: a short burst of noise and a click
 * Each layer has a level, pitch, decay and tone, and an effect of its own (drive, crunch, filter, ring mod) with a
 * wet mix; the layers sum into INTENSITY (a drive into a clipper: the distorted gabber kick). Platform-free like the
 * break engine. Settings from the main loop (kick_set, read once a block); triggers at sample offsets in the render. */
