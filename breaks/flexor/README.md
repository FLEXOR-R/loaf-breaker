# flexor/: FLEXOR's breaks

Breaks FLEXOR found while trying the BREAKS page (0.9.32), sampled from artists' records: they are **not** royalty
free, their rights belong to the artists and labels. They are here because FLEXOR chose to publish them; anyone building
on this should make their own call.

Put the WAVs here (any sample rate and bit depth; 16-bit or 24-bit PCM, or 32-bit float), whole bars, then give each
a line in [`../breaks.txt`](../breaks.txt): `flexor/FILE.wav`, its BPM, the bars that go into the firmware (2), the bars
the WAV holds, a name of up to 11 characters. A `*` puts it in the firmware; every line is in the site's library.
And a row in the table below: its "Artist, track" column, `Artist, "Track" (kind of break)`, is the name the site's
library shows (0.9.40, FLEXOR: `Artist – Track (kind)`, the FM-1's short name beside it; tools/break_lib.py `titles`).

FLEXOR's breaks are sliced on an even grid (FLEXOR: "EVEN GRID", as he sends them from the BREAKS page): `*=` (or `-=`)
in breaks.txt; and louder than the others: -12 dBFS RMS, 4 dB above the other breaks' -16 (0.9.35 had them at their files' own
level, FLEXOR: too loud). **Every break put here gets that level** (FLEXOR, 14 Nov 2026: his DJ library, mastered
alike; tools/prep_breaks.py `FOLDER_LOUD`), unless its line in breaks.txt says another (`@X` after the name). Their first three (Akira, "Custom Grind"; Detest & Tripped, "Hardcore to The Penis"; The Satan, "Gangzta
Cash") were taken out on 14 Nov 2026 for FLEXOR to make them again.
